# Introduction
This is a fullstack website developed using the Flask framework and deployed under the domain https://www.andyzhengblog.com/. Python is my preferred language so I decided to write the back-end logic using Python. If anybody has any suggestions, feel free to send me some! Thanks!

# Features
- Blog
- Portfolio page

I'm not sure what to put here since it's a personal website which hosts my blog and portfolio page. However, a lot of work was also done on the design.
