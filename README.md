# Introduction
This is a blog site developed using the Flask framework and deployed to Heroku under the domain https://www.andyzhengblog.com/. Python is one of, if not my favorite language so I decided to write the back-end logic using Python instead of the typical HTML, CSS, Javascript combo. If anybody has any suggestions, feel free to send me some!

# Features
- Nice carousels!
- Relaxed color scheme, and easy on the eyes.
- This is a personal website with a blog attached. You may contribute or simply browse the posts.

# Tech Stack
- Python and the Flask framework.
- HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
- SQLite

The site's back-end is written in Python with the aid of the Flask framework and SQLite to save user data into a database. The front-end templates were written using HTML and CSS to improve the site's look and other functionalities. Feel free to send me suggestions!
